# This slide deck shows a lot of the features of Xaringan: https://www.kirenz.com/slides/xaringan-demo-slides.html

# To use, add this to the slide title:   `r I(hexes(c("DATA606")))`
# It will use images in the images/hex_stickers directory (i.e. the filename is the paramter)
hexes <- function(x) {
  x <- rev(sort(x))
  markup <- function(pkg) glue::glue('<img src="images/hex/{pkg}.png" class="title-hex">')
  res <- purrr::map_chr(x, markup)

# Final Exam

* Will be available May 19th.

* Due by end of day May 23rd.

* You may use your book and course materials.

* I expect you to complete the exam on your own (i.e. do not discuss with classmates, colleagues, significant others, etc.)

* There are two parts:
	1. Part one multiple choice questions and short answer questions.
	2. Part two has a small data set to analyze with R, then answer some interpretation questions.

* Put your answers in the Rmarkdown file and submit the PDF file. **Please do not post your answers online!**

# My Work

My statistical research interest is in propensity score methods. Propensity score analysis (PSA) is a quasi-experimental design used to estimate causality from observational studies. It is generally conducted in two phases:

1. Estimate propensity scores (i.e. probability of being in the treatment) using the observed covariates.
	a. Check balance
	b. Re-estimate propensity scores
2. Estimate effect sizes using typical group differences (e.g. t-tests)

See my [Github repository](https://github.com/jbryer/psa) or [Intro to PSA slides](http://epsy887.bryer.org/slides/Intro_PSA.html). Also the PSA Shiny application:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
psa::psa_shiny()
```

Areas I have worked on:

* Multilevel PSA (see [`multilevelPSA`](http://jason.bryer.org/multilevelPSA) R package)
* Matching with non-binary treatments (see [`TriMatch`](http://jason.bryer.org/TriMatch) R package)
* Bootstrapping PSA (see [`PSAboot`](http://jason.bryer.org/PSAboot) R package)

# DAACS

[The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills](https://daacs.net) (DAACS) is a suite of technological and social supports to optimize student learning. DAACS  provides personalized feedback about studentsâ€™ strengths and weaknesses in  terms of key academic and self-regulated learning skills, linking them to the resources to help them be successful students.

Applications of Data Science:

* We use natural language processing and predictive models to machine score the essays.
* We use DAACS data to estimate "risk scores" for students failing so we can target them with resources to help them be successful.

Just learned we received $3.8 million grant from the Institute of Education Sciences to test the efficacy at three institutions. Official announcement to come in July.
